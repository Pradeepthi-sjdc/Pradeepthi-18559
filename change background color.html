        <h2>Social Media</h2>
        <p>Social media is a phrase we throw around a lot these days, often to describe what we post on sites and apps like Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and others.<br>So you can infer that social media are web-based sites that allow people to interact with each other.Some people have more of a restricted view of social media, often equating it to mean the same as social networking (a.k.a. Facebook, Snapchat, etc.).<br></p>
